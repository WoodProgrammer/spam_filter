# ANTI-SPAM MACHINE LEARNING EDUCATIONAL PROJECTS
It created by the Python Sci-kit Learn Python Machine Learning Kit
And I used numpy and pandas for cleaning data.
I will create a shell script;
  For installing these libs and kits

  For use this Spam-Filter:

  First:

  For Linux and MacOs:

      `$ python install pip`

  And after:

      `$ pip install virtualenv`

  After installed these modules succesfully:
      `cd spam_filter`
      `$ source  spam_mail/bin/activate`

      For:
        numpy->array
        scipy
        sklearn->machinelearning
      `(spam_mail)$ pip install sklearn/

       (spam_mail) $ pip install scipy

       (spam_mail)$ pip install numpy

       (spam_mail)$ pip install sklearn
      `
For training data:
I found this data-set from DAT8 justmarkham(DataSchool Founder)'s tutorials
